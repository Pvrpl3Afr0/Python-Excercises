#Question 1; What does this program print? Pay close attention to spaces.
#print("Hello","World","!")

print("Hello", "World", "!")

'''
Because of the spaces this program prints Hello World ! Instead of HelloWorld!
or Hello World!
'''

#Question 2: What is the compile-time error in this program?
#print("Hello", "World!)

print("Hello", "World!)
#This code won't work because the quote next to ! is missing.
'''
Question 3: Write three versions of the hello.py program that
have different compile-time errors.
'''

print("Hello" world!)
print(Hello world!)
print("hello," "world)

print("helo", "world!")

#Question 4: How do you discover compile-time errors? How do you discover
#run-time errors
'''
Compile time errors are essentially syntax errors, IDLE will tell you when it
encounters an unexpected character

Run time errors are logistical errors and the code won't always be able to see
them, to discover them its helpful to have pair programming
or troubleshooting your own code
'''
#Question 5
print("Hola!")

#Question 6
print(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)

#Question 7
